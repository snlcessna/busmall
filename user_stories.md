Developer (DEV)
1. As a DEV, I want to ensure that the app displays three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side, in accordance with the requests of the focus group.
2. As a DEV, I want to ensure that the size and aspect ratio of these three images are dynamic, so that users will be able to see all choices on one screen.
3. As a DEV, I want the app to not show results until there have been at least 25 selections made. That way their opinion won't be tainted by extraneous data.
4. As a DEV, I want to ensure that the look and feel of the app is easy to read and has a professional looking layout, to ensure the app doesn't distract from the end user experience.
